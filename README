Parse::IRCLog -- parse internet relay chat logs

This module provides a simple framework to parse IRC logs in arbitrary
formats.

A parser has a set of regular expressions for matching different events
that occur in an IRC log, such as "msg" and "action" events. Each line
in the log is matched against these rules and a result object,
representing the event stream, is returned.

The rule set, described in greated detail below, can be customized by
subclassing Parse::IRCLog. In this way, Parse::IRCLog can provide a
generic interface for log analysis across many log formats, including
custom formats.
